# Beolab-3500-Squeezebox

![Alt text](./images/ImageHighRes.jpg?raw=true "Beo3500 Squeezebox")

This project is to convert and Bang and Olufsen Beolab 3500 into a Logitech Media Server / Slimdevices Squeezebox using Raspberry Pi and PiCorePlayer.

My first Squeezebox1 I bought from the US direct, long long before it was into the UK and since the range has been obsoleted by Logitech I wanted something a bit more than a streamer alone. There is a lot of B&O stuff in our family and it was a natural way to go, and most elegant equipment that has like all electronic stuff is soon out of date.

The project has a requirement for 3d printed parts and homemade PCBs

In no way is this project affiliated or representative of Bang and Olufsen, Logitech or Slimdevices. I have utilised the logos in my fascia designs, but if they need removing as companies sometimes do, I can do that, but don't feel this harms your brand identies.
